# Tokdash Roadmap / Notes

_Last updated: 2026-06-02_

## History retention / durable usage store (deferred)
Tokdash recomputes everything live from client logs, so history erodes when a client deletes its
old logs — notably **Claude Code** and **Gemini CLI** (30-day default cleanup). **Decision
(2026-06): use config-based retention** — keep each client's own logs by raising/disabling its
cleanup window — rather than building an in-app snapshot store. Rationale, the full per-client
survey, and the one-line fixes live in [`docs/HISTORY_RETENTION.md`](../reference/HISTORY_RETENTION.md). A
fully-reviewed design for an in-app snapshot/durable store is **parked** in
[`docs/SNAPSHOTS_PLAN.md`](SNAPSHOTS_PLAN.md), to revisit only if a client ships
non-disable-able cleanup or multi-machine history sync becomes a goal.

## Goals
- **Easy install**: `pip install tokdash` (no Docker on the roadmap for now).
- **Easy run**: `tokdash serve` to start the local dashboard.
- **Accurate accounting**: only emit usage when clients provide **explicit** token fields.
- **Safe defaults**: bind to localhost by default; no surprise LAN exposure.

## Current state (today)
- FastAPI backend in:
  - `src/tokdash/api.py` (routes/app; serves `src/tokdash/static/index.html` + `/api/*`)
  - `src/tokdash/compute.py` (aggregation/merging logic)
- Local parsers in `src/tokdash/sources/coding_tools.py`:
  - ✅ OpenCode
  - ✅ Mimo / Mimocode
  - ✅ Codex
  - ✅ Claude Code
  - ✅ Gemini CLI
  - ✅ Antigravity CLI (token usage; Session Explorer drill-down is future work)
  - ✅ Kimi CLI
  - ✅ Pi
  - ✅ GitHub Copilot CLI
  - ✅ Hermes
  - 🟡 Amp (placeholder)
- OpenClaw parser in `src/tokdash/sources/openclaw.py` (reads `~/.openclaw/agents/*/sessions`).
- Local pricing DB: `src/tokdash/pricing_db.json`.

## Packaging plan (pip)
_Target UX:_
- `pip install tokdash`
- `tokdash serve` → open `http://127.0.0.1:55423`

_Phased approach:_
1. Add `pyproject.toml` and a `src/tokdash/` package layout.
2. ✅ Moved backend + parsers into `src/tokdash/` and removed `sys.path` hacks.
3. Bundle `static/` + `pricing_db.json` as package data (setuptools package-data).
4. ✅ Added a small CLI (`tokdash`) with subcommands:
   - `tokdash serve` (host/port/CORS/cache-ttl flags; env vars still supported)
   - `tokdash export --json` (one-shot terminal output)
5. Keep `python3 main.py` as a compatibility entrypoint temporarily (then deprecate).
6. ✅ Added GitHub Actions Trusted Publishing (OIDC) to publish to PyPI on version tags.

## Serving / background process
✅ We **document** background options but do not auto-install services. See `docs/guides/agents/systemd/BACKGROUND_RUN.md`.

- **Linux (recommended):** systemd *user* service template.
- **macOS:** launchd plist template.
- **Cross-platform fallbacks:** `tmux`, `nohup`, `screen`.
- Templates:
  - `docs/guides/agents/systemd/templates/tokdash.service`
  - `docs/guides/agents/systemd/templates/com.tokdash.tokdash.plist`

## Terminal mode (interactive TUI)
Decision: build a **full interactive** terminal UI (like `nvitop`/`nvtop`), as an optional extra.

- Command: `tokdash tui`
- Dependency: `tokdash[tui]` (keep core install minimal)
- Implementation: `textual`-based (interactive tables, keybindings, live refresh)
- v1 scope:
  - Period selector (today/week/month/N days)
  - Views: Overview / Tools / Models
  - Search + sort + drilldown (tool → model)
  - Auto-refresh toggle + manual refresh
  - Export current view to JSON (file/stdout)
- Non-goals (v1): charts/3D views; keep it fast and table-first

## Companion status app (planned)
Goal: at-a-glance usage/quota outside the browser tab. Phased to keep the core package at its
current 3 runtime dependencies; note the dashboard is already an installable PWA (manifest +
service worker), which covers the "standalone app window" want with zero code.

- **Tier 1 — script templates (zero new deps, ship first):** menu-bar/tray *plugins* under
  `docs/examples/`, same pattern as the statusline templates. Candidates: xbar/SwiftBar plugin
  (macOS menu bar), a small PowerShell tray script (Windows — also covers WSL2 servers via
  localhost forwarding), Waybar/i3status snippet (Linux). Each polls the local API read-only and
  renders e.g. `12.3M ($4.56) today` plus the nearest quota reset; fails silently when Tokdash
  isn't running.
- **Tier 2 — `tokdash[tray]` optional extra (demand-gated):** a real cross-platform tray icon via
  `pystray` (+`Pillow` for icon rendering) as an optional extra, mirroring the `tokdash[tui]`
  plan. Menu: open dashboard, today's totals, quota bars, quit. Caveats to respect: needs a GUI
  session (headless/WSL servers should use the Tier 1 Windows-side script instead), and Linux
  tray support is fragmented (appindicator vs legacy X tray).
- Non-goals: an Electron/Tauri desktop app (heavy, separate release train; the PWA already
  provides an app window).

## Dashboard update notice — ✅ shipped (Unreleased)
Opt-in update badge in the dashboard header backed by the existing `§14` update-check endpoints
(`/api/version`, `GET /api/update-check`, `POST /api/update-check/consent`). Constraints that
must hold for any future change: no network check without consent (§14), and the web UI never
executes the upgrade — it shows a copyable `tokdash update` command only (§15).

## Client / IDE support
Principle: **no inference**. Only emit entries when numeric token fields exist.

- Cursor:
  - Not supported right now.
  - Current best-known approach requires copying a browser session cookie/token (unsafe) and calling unofficial Cursor web APIs (unstable).
  - We will revisit only if Cursor exposes a safer official mechanism or reliable local artifacts with explicit token fields.
- VS Code extensions (Continue/Cline/Roo/Windsurf/Amazon Q):
  - Probe VS Code storage dirs for explicit token fields (JSON/SQLite).

## Quota tab — additional providers (planned)
The Quota tab currently tracks Codex, Claude Code, and Antigravity (per-provider opt-in network
polling + local sources). Same principles for every addition: read the user's own local CLI
credentials, call only that provider's own quota/usage endpoint, never refresh or write tokens,
default-off consent. Candidates, pending research into each provider's quota surface:

- **Z.ai Coding Plan** (GLM) — CN and Global variants; plan-quota endpoints to be researched.
- **MiniMax coding/token plans** — Global (`minimax.io`) and CN (`minimaxi.com`) variants.
- **Xiaomi MiMo plans** — MiMo CLI/API subscription quota.
- **Moonshot Kimi plans** — Kimi CLI already has token accounting in Tokdash; add plan-quota
  polling if Moonshot exposes a usage/limits endpoint.

Each addition needs: (1) a local credential seam (like `clientpaths` resolvers), (2) a probed +
fixture-frozen response shape, (3) a consent key, and (4) a provider card/series in the tab.

## README / polish
- Add a clear “Supported clients” matrix (✅ implemented vs 🟡 placeholder).
- Create a Tokdash logo (AIGC is fine) and set dashboard favicon to it.
- Add supported-client logos/badges (probably via shields.io) and a security note (LAN binding + CORS).
- Add UI demo assets:
  - screenshots in `docs/assets/` (overview + stats)
  - optional short GIF of refresh + scrolling

## Performance
Symptom: browser becomes less responsive while refreshing/scrolling.

Likely causes:
- Recreating Chart.js objects each refresh (and animating).
- Large DOM updates (apps breakdown + combined models) happening immediately.
- Overlapping refreshes (manual + auto refresh).

Fixes to keep:
- Reuse Chart.js instances and disable animations.
- Defer big table renders via `requestIdleCallback`.
- Cap combined-model rows by default with a “Show all” toggle.
- Skip Overview DOM work while user is on Stats.

## Pricing DB updates
- Keep `src/tokdash/pricing_db.json` open-source.
- Add a periodic pricing updater/scraper (in a separate private repo) to scrape OpenAI/OpenRouter/etc and regenerate `pricing_db.json` (bump `version` + `lastUpdated`), then open a PR here.
  - Keep schema/validator tests in the updater repo; Tokdash only consumes the generated JSON.

## Cleanup candidates
- Audit static assets for unused files.
- Delete local `__pycache__/` directories (already gitignored).
- Keep `requirements-dev.txt` (optional) as a pinned convenience file for contributors.

## Open questions
- Publish to PyPI immediately, or start with `pip install git+https://...`?
- If we allow `0.0.0.0`, do we want an auth token / basic auth option?
- Do we want Windows path support in v1?
