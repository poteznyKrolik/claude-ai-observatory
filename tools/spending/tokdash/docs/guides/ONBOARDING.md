# Onboarding: setup, doctor, update, uninstall

Tokdash ships a Python-native lifecycle so you can run it as a background service and
cleanly remove it later — no shell scripts, no `sudo`, no system-wide changes.

> **Install ≠ setup.** `pip install` / `pipx install` only installs the package. It
> creates no service, writes no config, and reaches no network. For new installs,
> **`tokdash setup` is the recommended first-run path**. **`tokdash serve` still works
> with zero setup**, so existing users (and anyone with a hand-written systemd/launchd
> unit) keep working unchanged. Everything setup creates is reversible with
> `tokdash uninstall`.

## Quick start

```bash
pipx install tokdash        # recommended: isolated env + a stable `tokdash` on PATH
tokdash setup               # configure + start a loopback-only background service
```

Then open the URL it prints (default `http://127.0.0.1:55423`). To remove everything
setup created while keeping your history:

```bash
tokdash uninstall
```

For scripts, agents, and bundlers, use the non-interactive contract:

```bash
tokdash setup --auto --json
```

## `tokdash setup`

Configures a user-level background service. Two routes, one engine:

| Route | Command | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Easy / auto | `tokdash setup --auto` | No prompts. Safe local-only defaults. Intended for scripts, CI, and bundlers. |
| Expert | `tokdash setup` | Shows the plan and asks before applying (requires a terminal). |

**Safety rule:** with no terminal *and* neither `--auto` nor `--yes`, setup prints the
plan and exits non-zero **without changing anything** — a command that wasn't explicitly
non-interactive never mutates your machine just because it ran without a TTY.

Useful flags (all reused from the global parser where noted):

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--auto` | Non-interactive easy route. |
| `-y`, `--yes` | Apply without prompting (interactive route, skip confirmation). |
| `--dry-run` | Print the plan and change nothing. |
| `--json` | Machine-readable result (for bundlers); non-zero exit on failure. |
| `--bind` / `--port` | Override bind address / port (default `127.0.0.1:55423`). |
| `--runtime {auto,existing,pipx,venv,binary}` | Which interpreter the service uses (see below). |
| `--service {auto,systemd,launchd,none}` / `--no-service` | Background service type. |
| `--force` | Replace a pre-existing **unmarked** `tokdash.service` (setup refuses by default). |

If you already have a hand-written `tokdash.service` or launchd plist, setup does not
silently replace it. By default it refuses unmarked service files, even if the port already
serves Tokdash. Keep managing that service yourself, remove it before setup, or run
`tokdash setup --force` after checking `tokdash setup --dry-run`. For pre-1.0 manual
systemd services that occupy `55423` but do not expose the new `/health` fingerprint,
`--force` rewrites and restarts the existing `tokdash.service`. Use `--no-service` when you
want setup state without creating a background service.

**Optional update-notices step (interactive only).** Just before the quota step, an
interactive setup also asks whether to enable opt-in update notices (default **Yes** — bare
Enter enables), calling the same `updatecheck.enable()` the dashboard's consent link uses.
The `TOKDASH_UPDATE_CHECK=0` hard kill switch (see "Update checks" below) skips the prompt
entirely, and it is skipped if update checks are already enabled. Like the quota step,
`--auto`, `--yes`, `--json`, and non-TTY runs skip it so scripted setup never prompts.

**Optional quota step (interactive only).** After a successful interactive setup, the wizard
offers the same quota-tracking decisions the dashboard's Quota tab exposes: the master switch
(`quota.enabled`), per-provider quota **API** consent (default No — without opting in, quota
stays local-only), and the background poll interval (15/30/60/120 minutes). `--auto`, `--yes`,
`--json`, and non-TTY runs skip the step entirely, so scripted setup never prompts; everything
can be changed later from the Quota tab or with `tokdash quota consent`.

### Runtime selection

- **`auto` / `existing`** (default): point the service at the interpreter that ran setup.
  No install, no network. Kept on uninstall.
- **`pipx`**: use an existing `pipx install tokdash` environment (run `pipx install
  tokdash` first). Kept on uninstall.
- **`venv`**: setup creates a dedicated managed venv under `<data_dir>/runtime/python-venv`,
  pinned to the version that ran setup, and **owns** it (removed on uninstall). Use this to
  isolate the service from a churn-prone conda/system environment.
- **`binary`**: reserved for future standalone binaries.

Setup never creates a `pipx` environment — pipx is *your* install path, so uninstall never
touches it.

### Migrating an existing setup to a managed venv

If setup currently records `install_method: existing` (common for conda, system Python, or
`python -m pip install --user` installs), `tokdash update` will not mutate that interpreter.
To let Tokdash own the service runtime and manage future upgrades, re-run setup with a
managed venv:

```bash
# Upgrade the tokdash command you are about to run, for example:
python3 -m pip install --user -U tokdash
# or, for a conda base install:
conda run -n base python -m pip install -U tokdash
tokdash setup --runtime venv --force
tokdash doctor
```

This keeps usage history and config under `<data_dir>`, rewrites the user service to run
`<data_dir>/runtime/python-venv/bin/python -m tokdash`, and records
`install_method: managed-venv` in `install.json`. Future `tokdash update` runs
`pip install -U tokdash` inside that venv and restarts the service. If your runtime is pipx,
you can keep it instead; `tokdash update` knows how to call `pipx upgrade tokdash`.

### Background service by platform

| Platform | Backend | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Linux / WSL2 (systemd) | systemd **user** service (`~/.config/systemd/user/tokdash.service`) | `--service auto` picks it when a user systemd manager is available |
| macOS | launchd **user** agent (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tokdash.tokdash.plist`) | `--service auto` picks it when `launchctl` is available |
| WSL2 without systemd / other | none | setup records the manifest + prints foreground guidance |

Both backends write a unit/plist carrying an ownership marker, bring it up, and are reverted
the same way by `tokdash uninstall`. No `sudo` for the local service, no system-wide units.

### Network behavior & remote access

Defaults are loopback-first: `127.0.0.1:55423`. `--auto` is **strictly local-only** and
refuses a non-loopback bind. The local API is unauthenticated, so **write endpoints are
automatically disabled unless the server is bound to loopback** (see `docs/SECURITY.md`).

Interactive `tokdash setup` can configure Tailscale Serve after explicit confirmation and
record the exact targeted teardown for `tokdash uninstall`. `--auto` never exposes the service;
it only prints remote-access guidance. SSH forwarding supports authenticated write access, while
an explicit non-loopback bind remains read-only.

See [`REMOTE_ACCESS.md`](REMOTE_ACCESS.md) for commands, URLs, WSL2 guidance, and the trade-offs
between Tailscale Serve, SSH forwarding, and wildcard binding. See [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md)
for the complete write-protection model.

## `tokdash doctor`

Diagnoses runtime fitness, the service (systemd or launchd), the recorded port,
prerequisites, and config/data locations — plus, if update checks are enabled, whether a
newer version is available. It also reports quota-tracking state: the master switch,
per-provider API consent, the `TOKDASH_QUOTA_POLL=0` kill switch, the effective poll
interval and its source (env/config/default), the last poll time, and the stored snapshot
count. `--json` for machine-readable output. It probes the **port
recorded in the manifest** (setup may have auto-picked a free one), and flags a
`TOKDASH_DATA_DIR` mismatch between the manifest and the current environment.

```bash
tokdash doctor          # human summary
tokdash doctor --json   # machine-readable
```

## `tokdash update`

Upgrades the runtime **in place** and restarts the service if it is managed. Because you
asked to upgrade, this works regardless of who owns the runtime — but only for an install
method Tokdash knows how to drive:

| Recorded install method | What `update` does |
|---|---|
| `pipx` | `pipx upgrade tokdash`, then restart a managed service |
| `managed-venv` | `pip install -U tokdash` inside the managed venv, then restart |
| `existing` (unknown package manager) | **Prints guidance, changes nothing** — upgrade it the way you installed it |
| `binary` | Deferred (prints guidance) |
| no manifest | Prints guidance (`tokdash setup` first, or upgrade manually) |

```bash
tokdash update            # upgrade + restart
tokdash update --dry-run  # show the exact command(s), change nothing
tokdash update --json     # machine-readable result
```

`update` never upgrades an interpreter setup did not create — it will not run
`pip install -U` against your system/conda Python. If the upgrade installs but the managed
service fails to restart, `update` reports failure (non-zero exit) rather than a misleading
success — the service would otherwise keep running the old code.

Human output and `--json` include the Tokdash runtime version before and after the upgrade
when it can be read. A real version change is shown as `old -> new`; an unchanged version is
reported as already current, while still noting whether the background service was restarted.

### Update checks (opt-in, default-off)

Tokdash never checks for updates on its own. You can opt in, and then a check runs only when
you explicitly ask:

- Enable with `TOKDASH_UPDATE_CHECK=1`, or persist consent (`POST /api/update-check/consent`,
  which the dashboard can call). `TOKDASH_UPDATE_CHECK=0` is a hard kill switch that overrides
  saved consent.
- When enabled, `tokdash doctor` reports whether a newer version is on PyPI, and
  `GET /api/update-check` (read-only — PyPI read + in-memory cache, not write-gated, so it
  works over Tailscale/WSL/any forward) returns the comparison.
  Results are cached for hours; there are no automatic background checks. The check only
  *reports* availability — it never runs an upgrade (run `tokdash update` for that).

## `tokdash uninstall`

Reverts **exactly** what setup created, driven by the `install.json` manifest — never by
guessing. It is an interactive wizard (mirror of setup) that asks the two decisions that
matter, with these confirmed defaults:

- Remove the setup-owned managed runtime? **default yes** (only when setup owns it)
- Delete usage history / config? **default no** (your data is kept)

```bash
tokdash uninstall              # interactive wizard
tokdash uninstall --auto       # apply the defaults non-interactively (bundler teardown)
tokdash uninstall --dry-run    # print the revert plan, change nothing
tokdash uninstall --purge      # also delete usage history + config
tokdash uninstall --keep-runtime   # remove the service but keep a managed runtime
tokdash uninstall --force      # remove an unmarked / replaced tokdash.service (see below)
```

### Safety guarantees

- **Never** uninstalls Python.
- **Never** removes a Tokdash install you made yourself (pipx / existing interpreter).
- **Never** deletes usage history unless you pass `--purge`.
- Removes a `tokdash.service` only when the on-disk unit still carries setup's ownership
  marker (`X-Tokdash-Managed`). If the manifest is missing, or the unit was replaced by a
  hand-written one, uninstall refuses and asks you to confirm with `--force`. The same
  marker rule protects the managed runtime tree (`.tokdash-managed`).
- Idempotent and partial-safe: a half-finished setup still converges to a clean state.

## State and the manifest

All setup state lives under the resolved data dir (`$TOKDASH_DATA_DIR`, else `~/.tokdash`):

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `<data_dir>/install.json` | The revert manifest (what setup created, ownership flags). |
| `<data_dir>/runtime/python-venv` | The managed venv (only with `--runtime venv`). |
| `<data_dir>/usage.sqlite3` (+ `-wal`/`-shm`) | Usage history (kept unless `--purge`). |
| `<data_dir>/pricing_db.json` | Dashboard pricing edits (override; fully replaces the packaged baseline when present, survives `tokdash update`; delete it to restore defaults). |
| `~/.config/systemd/user/tokdash.service` | The systemd user unit (honors `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`). |

Set `TOKDASH_DATA_DIR` to redirect **all** of the above (handy for testing setup/uninstall
safely against a throwaway directory).

`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` changes where Tokdash writes the systemd unit file, but it is not a full
systemd namespace. If your user manager already has `tokdash.service` loaded from another
path, setup verifies the loaded unit path and the configured `/health` endpoint before it
reports success.

## Bundling Tokdash from another package

A parent installer can onboard and tear down Tokdash through the `--auto --json` contract,
always invoking the exact interpreter it installed (never a bare `tokdash`):

```bash
# onboard
<that-python> -m tokdash setup --auto --json
# teardown (the runtime is parent-owned, so uninstall keeps it)
<that-python> -m tokdash uninstall --auto --json
# then remove what you installed, e.g. `pipx uninstall tokdash`
```

`--json` results carry `ok` plus the resolved URL/service details; a non-zero exit means
the action failed (or was refused). Check `ok` / the exit code, not the prose.
